# Mathematical-Modeling-and-Stability-Analysis-of-Systemic-Risk-in-the-Banking-Ecosystem

This work investigates the dynamics of systemic risk in banking networks by analyzing equilibrium points and stability conditions. The focus is on a model that
incorporates interactions among distressed and undistressed banks. The equilibrium points are determined by solving a reduced system of equations, considering both
homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Local and global stability analyses reveal conditions under which equilibrium points are stable or unstable. Numerical
simulations further illustrate the dynamics of systemic risk, while the theoretical findings offer insights into the behavior of distressed banks under varying conditions. Overall, the model enhances our understanding of systemic financial risk and offers valuable insights for risk management and policymaking in the banking sector
